# ClassTrack â€“ Advanced Attendance App  

ClassTrack is a modern management app. It works as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** on iOS and as a **native Android app** (via Capacitor/TWA).  

## âœ¨ Features (MVP)  
- One-time **teacher registration** (stored locally).  
- **Create classes** with subject & schedule.  
- **Upload Excel** with student details (enrollment no, name, registration number).  
- **Swipe-based attendance system** â€“ swipe right = present, left = absent.  
- **Export attendance** as CSV for each class & date.  
- **Local data storage** (no backend required initially).  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack  
- **React + Vite** for frontend.  
- **TailwindCSS** for styling.  
- **xlsx (SheetJS)** for Excel parsing.  
- **PWA** support for cross-platform usage.  
- **Capacitor / TWA** for Android APK.
